Today's lecture for me went well. I have alot of experience with testing ruby files, using rspec. Pytest is pretty similar, and the concepts are very similar so I caught onto this pretty well. Some of the install commands for pytest didn't work for me. I'm on a 2019 mac, and one of the dependencies called six is apart of the os and the installer tries to update it but the OS prevents this so I had to run a different command to skip six.
